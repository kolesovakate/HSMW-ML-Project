# HSMW-ML-Project
Machine Learning Project: GMM, SNPC

### Tasks
Part 1:
1. Determine a reasonable number of clusters inside the data. Decide for
your own which measure you will choose to evaluate this reasonable
number.
2. Fit a GMM model with the data and choose the number of components
regarding your outcome of the 1st task.

Part 2:
1. You should implement the algorithm assigned to you (SNPC) and train
it on the given training data. Try to find an optimal number of prototypes
using cross validation.
2. There is another set of data which is unlabeled. You have to
classify it with your trained result.
